# Microsoft Azure AI Service - QnA Maker

## Introduction
Azure QnA Maker is a cloud-based service that enables developers to create a knowledge base (KB) of question-and-answer pairs. It helps in building conversational AI experiences by extracting structured Q&A content from sources such as FAQs, product manuals, and documents. The QnA Maker service integrates easily with Azure Bot Service, making it a popular choice for chatbots and virtual assistants.

### **Key Features**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Understands user queries and fetches the most relevant response.
- **Custom Knowledge Base**: Allows users to create, edit, and manage Q&A pairs.
- **Multi-language Support**: Supports multiple languages for international applications.
- **Easy Integration**: Works seamlessly with Azure Bot Service and other AI tools.
- **Active Learning**: Improves response accuracy by suggesting new questions.

## **Python Code Example**
To interact with QnA Maker using Python, we will:
1. Send a question to the QnA Maker API.
2. Receive the best-matching answer.

### **Install Required Libraries**
```python
import requests
import json
```

### **Set Up API Endpoint and Key**
```python
# Replace with your actual endpoint and keys
QNAMAKER_ENDPOINT = "https://your-qna-maker-endpoint.azurewebsites.net/qnamaker"
KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID = "your-knowledge-base-id"
SUBSCRIPTION_KEY = "your-subscription-key"

# Endpoint for querying the knowledge base
QUERY_URL = f"{QNAMAKER_ENDPOINT}/knowledgebases/{KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID}/generateAnswer"
```

### **Function to Ask Questions**
```python
def get_answer_from_qna_maker(question):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"EndpointKey {SUBSCRIPTION_KEY}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = json.dumps({"question": question})
    
    response = requests.post(QUERY_URL, headers=headers, data=payload)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        answer = response.json()["answers"][0]["answer"]
        return answer
    else:
        return f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}"

# Example Query
question = "What is Microsoft Azure?"
answer = get_answer_from_qna_maker(question)
print("Bot's Response:", answer)
```

## **Integration with Azure Bot Service**
To make QnA Maker accessible via a chatbot, follow these steps:
1. **Create an Azure Bot Service** and select QnA Maker as the knowledge source.
2. **Configure Bot Channels** (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Web Chat, Slack).
3. **Deploy and Test** the chatbot.

```python
from botbuilder.core import BotFrameworkAdapter
from botbuilder.ai.qna import QnAMaker, QnAMakerEndpoint

# Set up QnA Maker endpoint
qna_maker = QnAMaker(
    QnAMakerEndpoint(
        knowledge_base_id=KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID,
        endpoint_key=SUBSCRIPTION_KEY,
        host=QNAMAKER_ENDPOINT
    )
)
```
